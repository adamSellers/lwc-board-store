This deck is the perfect partner in crime for that all around freestyle ripper who's limits know no boundaries. The Huck Knife is a true twin shape that features Salomon's Quad Camber profile which adds a mild camber zone in between the bindings, a more extreme camber under the feet and slight rockered zones towards the contact points. This hybrid profile allows the board to retain tons of pop and power off jumps, lips, and transitions while still remaining playful. Another unique feature to the Huck Knife is the EQ RAD Sidecut which is a blend of equalizer and radial lines that blend together instead of a traditional curved edge that creates a perfect balance of agility and response edge to edge. Polish this deck off with a sintered base for high-density speed and a porous structure to help retain more wax upon tuning. The Salomon Huck Knife men's snowboard has been a renowned choice for urban and park maniacs for the last few years, and that probably won't change anytime soon.",

Ride went ahead and added Cleave Edge Steel edges that are made from 50% thicker steel, to help you keep those edges intact when nailing them against all things that are not snow. Ride's Roll-In Slimewalls are a urethane sidewall that helps dampen vibration at higher speeds and absorb any extra abuse you throw at this thing.
